# ProofPass REST API Contract (v1)

This document specifies the REST API contract for **ProofPass Member 2 (Backend, Database, and Integration)**.

---

## 1. Core Principles & Architecture

ProofPass provides an evidence-first technical credibility passport. The backend coordinates:
1. **Intake & Extraction**: PyMuPDF-based PDF resume text extraction or raw text intake.
2. **Claim Identification**: M4 Intelligence extracts technical skill claims (LLM proposal with heuristic fallback).
3. **Repository Verification**: M3 Evidence Engine verifies claims deterministically against public GitHub repositories.
4. **Micro-Quiz Generation**: Evidence-grounded quiz generation to verify claimed authorship and technical depth.
5. **Deterministic State Assignment**: Deterministic claim-state transitions (`Verified`, `Supported`, `Claimed`, `Contradicted`) and role-match scoring.
6. **Cryptographic Integrity Sealing**: Canonical JSON formatting (RFC 8785) and SHA-256 digest computation.
7. **SQLite Persistence**: Stored via SQLAlchemy with support for candidate data erasure (right to deletion).

> **Important Security & Integrity Note**:
> The SHA-256 digest serves purely as a **tamper-detection integrity seal** over the canonical serialized payload. It confirms that a stored passport has not been altered since issuance. It does **not** constitute an asymmetric digital signature (such as Ed25519) and does **not** assert candidate legal identity or warranty external truth.

## 2. Server Configuration & CORS

- **Default Base URL**: `http://localhost:8000`
- **API Prefix**: `/api/v1`
- **CORS Policy**: Configurable via `CORS_ORIGINS`.
  - Allowed default origins: `http://localhost:5173`, `http://localhost:3000`, `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.
  - Credentials are only permitted when explicit origins are specified (never combined with `*`).

  "target_role": "Full-Stack Engineer",
  "consent": true
}
```

- **Response** (`200 OK`): `AnalyzeResponse` containing `passport_id`, `role_match_score`, `sha256_hash`, and full `PassportPayload`.

---

### 3.3 Candidate Intake via PDF File Upload
- **Route**: `POST /api/v1/analyze/upload`
- **Content-Type**: `multipart/form-data`
- **Description**: Dedicated multipart endpoint tailored for interactive file uploads in Swagger UI and form clients.
- **Form Fields**:
  - `resume_file`: Uploaded `.pdf` binary file (required).
  - `github_url`: Public GitHub repository or profile URL (required).
  - `target_role`: Target role name, e.g. `"Full-Stack Engineer"` (required).
  - `job_description`: Optional job description text.
  - `consent`: Explicit candidate consent boolean (required, must be `true`).
  - `allow_network`: Boolean controlling external GitHub calls (default: `true`).
- **Response** (`200 OK`): `AnalyzeResponse` matching `POST /api/v1/analyze`.

---

### 3.3 Get Passport
- **Route**: `GET /api/v1/passports/{id}`
- **Description**: Retrieves full passport by ID.
- **Response** (`200 OK`): `PassportDetailResponse` containing metadata and full `PassportPayload`.
- **Errors**:
  - `404 Not Found`: Passport ID does not exist.

---

### 3.4 Get Micro-Verification Quiz
- **Route**: `GET /api/v1/passports/{id}/quiz`
- **Description**: Returns micro-verification quiz questions generated for this passport's evidence.
- **Privacy & Anti-Cheat Guarantee**: Expected answer hints (`expected_answer_hints`) are strictly stripped from the response.
- **Response** (`200 OK`):
```json
[
  {
    "question_id": "qq_1a2b3c4d",
    "claim_id": "cl_98765432",
    "skill": "React",
    "question_type": "fake_premise",

    "context_snippet": null
  }
]
```

### 3.5 Submit Quiz Answers
- **Route**: `POST /api/v1/passports/{id}/quiz/answers`
- **Description**: Submits candidate answers. Evaluates responses with M4 rubric, updates skill claim states (e.g., from `Supported` to `Verified`), updates role match scores, and recalculates the SHA-256 integrity seal atomically.
- **Request Body**:
```json
{
  "answers": [
    {
      "question_id": "qq_1a2b3c4d",
      "answer_text": "I did not use Redis in this frontend React repository."
    }
  ]
